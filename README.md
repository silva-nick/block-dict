<h3>About:</h3>
<p>Block-dictionary is a Chinese to English dictionary with the added functionality of helping you expand your Chinese vocabulary by suggesting new compound words. In Chinese, individual characters are often combined totally transforming their meaning. Here's one example:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>马: Horse 上: On <BR>马上: At Once</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>So, Block-dictionary hopes to help learners expand their vocabulary without having to learn new characters.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>All you have to do is input a list of Chinese characters and wait, soon you can see hundreds of new permutations of your words.</p>
<h3>Future:</h3>
  <p> Currently, Block-Dictionary only serves valid permutations of any two Chinese words. In the future, I hope to expand that while keeping the base functionality fast and efficient even with large inputs. Also I hope to add an instruction page for first-time users and a sorting feature to make it easier to navigate long lists. </p>
